# 1 - We want to be able to quickly determine the state abbreviation for the states in the United States.
# Determine whether it is best to use an array or a hash, and create it storing at least 4 states and their abbreviations.
# Then write code to print out only the states, then only the abbreviations, and finally nicely formatted output displaying both the states and their abbreviations.
# e.g., The abbreviation for Nebraska is NE

# code:
# state_abbreviation = {
#   washington: "WA",
#   california: "CA",
#   Nebraska: "NE",
#   colorado: "CO"
# }
# # print out only state
# state_abbreviation.each_key { |state| puts state}

# # print out only abbreviation
# state_abbreviation.each_value { |abbreviation| puts abbreviation }

# # printv out both state and abbreviation
# state_abbreviation.each { |state, abbreviation| puts "The abbreviatgion for #{state} is #{abbreviation}."}

# 2_We want to be able to quickly determine the amount of different types of food items you have in your house.
# Determine whether it is best to use an array or a hash, and create it storing at least 4 food items and their quantities.
# Then write code to print out all the items and their quantities using nicely formatted output.

# code:
# food = {
#   pasta: 4,
#   banana: 6,
#   apple: 3,
#   mango: 8
# }

# food.each { |item, quantity| puts "#{quantity} #{item}"}
